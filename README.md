# sanity-translations-tab

This is the base module for implementing common translation vendor tasks from a Studio, such as sending content to be translated in some specific languages, importing content back etc. Not useful on its own, but a vendor specific plugin will use this for its chrome.

## development

To work on this module locally, run

```
npm start
```

To observe changes to the code, and at the same time run

```
